Do you want to learn AI, but don’t know where to start? Well, we have listed 5 great platforms and courses to help you learn how to create your own AI’s in no time! These sites all require a basic knowledge of coding, so if you don’t know how to code yet, then you might want to check out our post here on the best places to learn coding. The sites listed in this article will teach you everything that you need to know about AI, including how they work, how to make them, and how they might be used in real world situations.

# **Best websites to learn AI**

## Udacity

Udacity is a great resource for learning AI. As a startup founded in 2011, they've designed their platform of classes with the needs of first-time users in mind. Their curriculum is designed by industry experts, and they offer many different course tracks, including an Intro to AI, Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Making Money with Machine Learning.

If you sign up for one of their Nanodegree programs (the "intro" courses are free), you'll take on projects involving everything from self-driving cars to chatbots. They also have an active community forum where you can ask questions and receive feedback from other Udacity students.

## Coursera

Coursera is a great place for middle schoolers to learn about AI. You can take courses from top universities around the world and industry experts, earning certificates or degrees along the way. Financial aid is available, so you can work toward your goals without having to pay out of pocket! There is also a huge selection of courses for you to take, so that you can find the one that’s the best fit for you. 

Many of the courses are also taught by some of the best colleges and universities in the country, so you know that you’re getting high quality courses. Whether you choose to complete your program at your own pace or to join peers in a guided track, Coursera is a fantastic resource!

## Udemy

Udemy is a very useful resource, and there are several reasons why you should consider taking AI courses on this platform. First of all, it's free to sign up and create an account on Udemy. Although some courses can be expensive, you can also enroll in plenty of free or inexpensive classes (including ones about AI).

The community surrounding Udemy is also very friendly and welcoming. Not only will you receive feedback from the course instructors, but other students will likely be able to answer any questions that pop up along the way.

Lastly, Udemy has excellent teaching material when it comes to AI courses specifically. The instructors are knowledgeable about their topics and have clear communication styles that make the material easy to understand for anyone who decides to take their courses. You can even read reviews before deciding which instructor to learn from—so you know what others thought before spending money on one course versus another.

## Skillshare

Skillshare is an online learning platform with courses on a wide variety of subjects, including AI. It has over 30,000 courses, and each one is taught by an expert in their field. Skillshare also has free and premium membership options, so If you’re looking to learn AI but don’t want to spend too much money, then Skillshare might be the place for you.

You can sign up for the Skillshare free trial [here](https://www.skillshare.com/signup?redirectTo=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.skillshare.com%2Fmembership%2Fcheckout%3Fvia%3Dsite-banner&via=site-banner). This gives you access to the entire course library for 7 days.

If you like what you see during your trial period, you can sign up for a $15 per month premium membership (after the trial period ends). However, if that doesn’t fit your budget, many of the courses are also available to take without a paid subscription.

Finally, Skillshare has a mobile app available on iOS and Android so that you can learn while away from your computer. If you’re going on a trip and still want to learn, then Skillshare would be a good choice for you.

## edX

Next up is edX. Founded in 2012 by Harvard University and MIT, edX is a non-profit MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses) provider. Like Coursera and Udacity, it offers free online courses to anyone who decides that they want to enroll in them. However, unlike the other two platforms, its primary focus is academic learning rather than career development.

Although it's not the largest player in the market, edX has become a leading provider of AI courses. It currently lists over 100 AI courses on its platform—more than any other MOOC provider out there. Many of these courses are offered by top universities from around the world, including MIT, Harvard University, Berkeley, and Australian National University (ANU).

## Udacity, Coursera, Udemy, Skillshare, and edX are all great resources for learning AI.

All of these sites provide real-world examples of machine learning and AI, taught by professionals in the field. The courses on these platforms are available for anyone to take and often include projects that can be used on your resume.

Here are some of the top courses:

* Udacity's Intro to Machine Learning Nanodegree: Covers Python, linear regression, K-means clustering and other fundamental concepts. Includes 7 hours of online instruction per week over a period of several months. This course is also 100% free, making it a great course if you are on a tight budget.

* Coursera's Machine Learning Specialization: A college course available through Coursera that includes 5 parts, starting with basic principles and moving up to neural networks and sequence models. Each part takes an estimated 2 months to complete if you spend 10 hours per week on it, though you can move at a slower pace if needed. There is no fee for watching lectures or taking quizzes, but you must pay a $49 monthly subscription to submit assignments or receive a certificate upon completion.[[Click here to see.](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning)]
* Udemy's Complete 2022 Data Science & Machine Learning Bootcamp: A comprehensive introduction to machine learning concepts including Python programming language fundamentals, data manipulation with scikit-learn, and implementing supervised learning algorithms for classification problems such as decision trees and random forests. [[Click here to see.](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-data-science-machine-learning-bootcamp/)]
* Skillshare’s Data Science and Machine Learning with Python - Hands On!: A great course that is easy to comprehend and that is beginner friendly. Contains many machine learning concepts and has multiple hands-on projects to help you understand machine learning concepts even better. Contains about ten and a half hours of video content.
