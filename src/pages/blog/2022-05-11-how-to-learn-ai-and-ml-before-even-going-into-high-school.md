Are you a middle schooler who wants to learn AI and ML before you graduate?

Well guess what: You can! The only thing stopping you from learning AI and ML is your own desire to learn. No matter where you are in life, no matter what your financial situation is like—if you want to learn AI and ML, there are options out there for you.

## Plan for success.

Learning AI / ML / Programming can seem daunting at first. 

If you're anything like me, learning can feel like a chore. I often find myself wondering, "How am I ever going to get this?" and "Is this really worth my time?" But the truth is that learning AI, ML, and programming isn't about being smart—it's about persistence.

It helps to answer some basic questions: 

1. What's your motivation? Why do you want to learn it? Do you have an end goal or are you just curious?
2. What will you do when you hit your first roadblock? 
3. How much time can you commit every week? Is it 2 hours, 10 hours, 50 hours?
4. What do you want to learn about? Do you want to build a chatbot or create a model from scratch or just understand how it works?



## Choosing the right learning path for you. 

What kind of learner are you? Are there any tools that will help support the way in which your brain processes information better so that it's easier for YOU personally to learn this complex subject matter (e.g., visual learners might benefit from using videos while auditory learners might benefit from using podcasts).

How much money do you have available for learning resources, books, courses etc.?

## Measuring progress

 Seeing where you are in your learning path is a great way to check in with yourself and see if the things you are doing are working for you.

If you're not making progress, it could be because of several reasons:

* Your goals are too high and unrealistic. You might need to lower them so that they are more achievable.
* You don't have enough time in your day to dedicate to learning. Try making a schedule for yourself, or finding other ways to make time for it outside of school hours.
* The method of learning isn't effective for your situation - maybe it's too slow, or too fast? Try something else!



## Finally, get out there in the real world!

The world of AI and ML is an exciting, ever-changing field, and it's important to stay on top of the latest trends.

As you've been learning about artificial intelligence and machine learning, then you may have noticed that there are tons of competitions and communities out there where you can apply what you've learned.

The world of AI competition is a very active one, with new competitions popping up all the time. It's a great way to get valuable experience working on real problems with other people who love computer science as much as you do.

You'll also meet some great mentors along the way. Many competitions offer support from industry leaders in the field or even former winners of similar competitions. You'll learn a lot from their experiences!
